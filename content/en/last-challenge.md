The director has two National Parks left to visit on our islands, but he doesn't know which one to go to first and wants it to be a surprise. We will help him make this decision by creating a puzzle tailored to him.

### 1. Choose which National Park you want the director to visit. You can consult [the collaborative encyclopedia of the Government of the Canary Islands](https://www3.gobiernodecanarias.org/medusa/wiki/index.php?title=PÃ¡gina_principal) to learn more about the archipelago.
<br />

### 2. Now let's create a puzzle to challenge the director to solve it. Remember what a puzzle is:
<br />

> A problem or challenge that uses mathematical concepts to arrive at a solution.
<br />

### 3. The puzzle must have 1 or more mathematical concepts:

- **Numbers and operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Fractions and decimals**.
- **Geometry**: geometric shapes or calculations of area and perimeter.
- **Basic algebra**: using simple equations like the ones we have worked on during the Learning Situation.
<br />

### 4. Make sure the puzzle is clear and has a well-defined solution.
<br />

### 5. Choose the delivery format:

- **Text**: Write it on paper, make a poster or drawing.
- **Digital**: Create a slideshow presentation.
- **Video**: Record a video presenting the puzzle.
- **Breakout**: create a box with locks that open with the clues that need to be solved.
<br />

### 6. Don't forget to add the solution to the puzzle and the steps to arrive at it.
<br />

### 7. Upload the created document to the corresponding assignment in the EVAGD of the subject.
<br />

### 8. The teacher will send it to the director.
